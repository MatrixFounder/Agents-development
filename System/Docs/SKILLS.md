# System Skills Catalog

The Agentic System v3.0 relies on a modular **Skills System**. Skills are reusable packages of instructions that extend agent capabilities.

## 📁 Library Layout
Skills are located in `.agent/skills/`.

## ⚙️ How it Works

The Skills System separates **"Who"** (Agent Persona) from **"What"** (Capabilities).
- **Persona (`System/Agents/`)**: Defines the role, tone, and high-level responsibilities (e.g., "You are an Architect").
- **Skill (`.agent/skills/`)**: Defines specific procedures, checklists, or technical standards (e.g., "How to design a DB").

### Principles
1.  **Dynamic Loading**: Agents load only the skills they need for a specific task.
2.  **Modularity**: Improvements to `skill-tdd-stub-first` automatically benefit all agents using it.
3.  **Cross-Platform**: The same skill definitions work in both Cursor and Antigravity.

## 🚀 Dynamic Loading

The Orchestrator dynamically dynamically constructs the Agent's prompt by combining three elements:

1.  **Base Role** (`System/Agents/<agent_name>.md`): The core persona (e.g., "You are a Developer").
2.  **Active Skills** (`ACTIVE SKILLS` list in Role): The specific capabilities required for the task.
3.  **Task Context**: The user's request and project context.

### Prompt Assembly Process
When an Agent is initialized:
1.  The system reads the **Base Role** file.
2.  It parses the `ACTIVE SKILLS` section (YAML or list mechanism).
3.  It loads the content of each referenced skill from `.agent/skills/`.
4.  It appends a `### LOADED SKILLS` section to the system prompt containing the full text of these skills.

**Simplified Prompt Structure:**

```markdown
[Base Role Content: "You are the Developer..."]

### LOADED SKILLS

#### SKILL: skill-tdd-stub-first
[Content of skill-tdd-stub-first.md]

#### SKILL: skill-core-principles
[Content of skill-core-principles.md]

[Task Description]
```

## 🏷️ Skill Tiers

To optimize token usage, skills are classified into three tiers (Lazy Loading Protocol).
**Authoritative Source:** [System/Docs/SKILL_TIERS.md](SKILL_TIERS.md)

1.  **TIER 0 (System Foundation)**: Always loaded at bootstrap. Mandatory for basic operation (e.g., `skill-safe-commands`).
2.  **TIER 1 (Phase-Triggered)**: Loaded automatically when entering a specific phase (Analysis, Planning, etc.).
3.  **TIER 2 (Extended)**: Loaded only on explicit request or for specialized workflows.
4.  **TIER 3 (High Assurance)**: Strict, rigorous protocols for critical stability. Replaces or hardens Tier 1 instructions (e.g., `tdd-strict`). Only for critical tasks.

## 🧪 Isolated Testing Skills

Testing skills in isolation allows you to verify prompts, check compliance with instructions, and iterate quickly without running the full Orchestrator pipeline.

### Option 1: Python Script (Recommended)
We provide a helper script to test skills with any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, xAI, OpenRouter, etc.).

1.  **Locate the script**: [`examples/skill-testing/test_skill.py`](examples/skill-testing/test_skill.py).
2.  **Configure**: Edit the `ROLE_FILE`, `TARGET_SKILLS`, and `TEST_TASK` variables in the `__main__` block.
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
    # Optional: export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.other-provider.com/v1"
    python3 examples/skill-testing/test_skill.py
    ```

### Option 2: n8n / Low-Code
You can use n8n or any flow-based tool. We provide a ready-to-import workflow with **Sticky Notes (Stickers)** acting as hints for configuration.

1.  **Download the Workflow**: [`examples/skill-testing/n8n_skill_eval_workflow.json`](examples/skill-testing/n8n_skill_eval_workflow.json).
2.  **Import to n8n**: Go to Workflow -> Import from File.
3.  **Follow the Stickers**: The workflow canvas contains Sticky Notes explaining where to paste your Role content and where the Prompt Assembly logic lives.
4.  **Execute**: Run the workflow to see the assembled prompt and the AI's response.

## ✅ Best Practices

When creating or modifying skills, follow these guidelines to ensure effectiveness and maintainability.

### 0. Creation Standard (V2)
**ALWAYS** start your skill implementation using the **Skill Creator standard**:
- Path: [`.agent/skills/skill-creator`](../.agent/skills/skill-creator)
- Reasoning: Ensures compliance with structure, testing, and validation scripts from Day 1.

### 1. Granularity & Size
- **Keep it Focused**: A skill should do *one* thing well.
- **Token Limit**: Keep `SKILL.md` under **1000 tokens**. Move heavy content to resources.
- **Script-First (Optimization O6a)**: If a skill contains complex logic (e.g., "scan this project structure"), **DO NOT** write 5 pages of instructions.
    - ✅ **Correct:** Write a Python script (`scripts/scan.py`) and instruct the agent to run it.
    - ❌ **Incorrect:** "Look at file X, then check Y, then if Z..." (Unreliable & expensive).

### 2. Instruction Style
- **Imperative**: Use "You MUST", "DO NOT".
- **Example Separation (Optimization O6a)**: **NEVER** put large examples inline in `SKILL.md`.
    - ✅ **Correct:** "See `examples/auth_flow.py`".
    - ❌ **Incorrect:** Large code blocks inside the prompt (wastes tokens).
- **Resource Extraction**: Move checklists, templates, and patterns to `resources/` directory.

### 3. Versioning & Updates
- **Breaking Changes**: Check usage via `grep -r "skill-name" System/Agents`.
- **Validation**: ALWAYS run `validate_skill.py` before committing.

### 4. Anti-Patterns
- ❌ **Inline Bloat**: Large ASCII art, huge tables, or inline templates.
- ❌ **Duplication**: Re-listing OWASP rules instead of linking to `security-audit`.
- ❌ **Hardcoded Paths**: Use relative structure or standard vars.
