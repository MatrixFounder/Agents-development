# System Skills Catalog

The Agentic System v3.0 relies on a modular **Skills System**. Skills are reusable packages of instructions that extend agent capabilities.

## 📁 Library Layout
Skills are located in `.agent/skills/`.

## ⚙️ How it Works

The Skills System separates **"Who"** (Agent Persona) from **"What"** (Capabilities).
- **Persona (`System/Agents/`)**: Defines the role, tone, and high-level responsibilities (e.g., "You are an Architect").
- **Skill (`.agent/skills/`)**: Defines specific procedures, checklists, or technical standards (e.g., "How to design a DB").

### Principles
1.  **Dynamic Loading**: Agents load only the skills they need for a specific task.
2.  **Modularity**: Improvements to `skill-tdd-stub-first` automatically benefit all agents using it.
3.  **Cross-Platform**: The same skill definitions work in both Cursor and Antigravity.

## 🚀 Dynamic Loading

The Orchestrator dynamically dynamically constructs the Agent's prompt by combining three elements:

1.  **Base Role** (`System/Agents/<agent_name>.md`): The core persona (e.g., "You are a Developer").
2.  **Active Skills** (`ACTIVE SKILLS` list in Role): The specific capabilities required for the task.
3.  **Task Context**: The user's request and project context.

### Prompt Assembly Process
When an Agent is initialized:
1.  The system reads the **Base Role** file.
2.  It parses the `ACTIVE SKILLS` section (YAML or list mechanism).
3.  It loads the content of each referenced skill from `.agent/skills/`.
4.  It appends a `### LOADED SKILLS` section to the system prompt containing the full text of these skills.

**Simplified Prompt Structure:**

```markdown
[Base Role Content: "You are the Developer..."]

### LOADED SKILLS

#### SKILL: skill-tdd-stub-first
[Content of skill-tdd-stub-first.md]

#### SKILL: skill-core-principles
[Content of skill-core-principles.md]

[Task Description]
```

## 🧪 Isolated Testing Skills

Testing skills in isolation allows you to verify prompts, check compliance with instructions, and iterate quickly without running the full Orchestrator pipeline.

### Option 1: Python Script (Recommended)
We provide a helper script to test skills with any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, xAI, OpenRouter, etc.).

1.  **Locate the script**: [`examples/skill-testing/test_skill.py`](examples/skill-testing/test_skill.py).
2.  **Configure**: Edit the `ROLE_FILE`, `TARGET_SKILLS`, and `TEST_TASK` variables in the `__main__` block.
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
    # Optional: export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.other-provider.com/v1"
    python3 examples/skill-testing/test_skill.py
    ```

### Option 2: n8n / Low-Code
You can use n8n or any flow-based tool. We provide a ready-to-import workflow with **Sticky Notes (Stickers)** acting as hints for configuration.

1.  **Download the Workflow**: [`examples/skill-testing/n8n_skill_eval_workflow.json`](examples/skill-testing/n8n_skill_eval_workflow.json).
2.  **Import to n8n**: Go to Workflow -> Import from File.
3.  **Follow the Stickers**: The workflow canvas contains Sticky Notes explaining where to paste your Role content and where the Prompt Assembly logic lives.
4.  **Execute**: Run the workflow to see the assembled prompt and the AI's response.

## ✅ Best Practices

When creating or modifying skills, follow these guidelines to ensure effectiveness and maintainability.

### 1. Granularity & Size
- **Keep it Focused**: A skill should do *one* thing well (e.g., "Requirements Analysis" vs "Do Everything").
- **Token Limit**: Try to keep skill files under **1500 tokens**. Large prompts dilute attention.
- **Reference**: If a skill needs to reference another (e.g., "See Architecture Guide"), use the file path or a brief summary, don't copy-paste.

### 2. Instruction Style
- **Imperative**: Use "You MUST", "DO NOT", "ALWAYS". avoid "It is recommended to".
- **Structured**: Use Markdown extensively. Lists, bold text, and code blocks help the model parse instructions.
- **Examples**: Provide "Good vs Bad" examples. This is the most effective way to align the model.

### 3. Versioning & Updates
- **Breaking Changes**: If you fundamentally change a skill (e.g., `skill-tdd-stub-first`), verify it against *all* agents that use it.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: If possible, keep the same file name. If a total rewrite is needed, create `skill-name-v2.md` and gradually migrate agents.

### 4. Anti-Patterns
- ❌ **Duplication**: Don't repeat "You are a helpful assistant" in every skill. That belongs in the Base Role.
- ❌ **Conflict**: Ensure `skill-A` doesn't contradict `skill-B` (e.g., one says "write tests first", another says "write tests last").
- ❌ **Hardcoded Paths**: Use relative paths or context variables where possible, as directory structures vary.
