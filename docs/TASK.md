# Task: Analyze TDD Improvements

## Goal
Analyze the requirements from `Backlog/TDD_improvement.md` and produce a detailed report on feasibility and implementation strategy.

## Context
The user wants to strengthen the TDD / Stub-First methodology in the Agentic-Development framework by adding strict verification steps ("Expected Fail Reason", "Minimal Code to Pass") and explicit bug-fix protocols.

## Objectives
- [x] Analyze `Backlog/TDD_improvement.md`.
- [x] Verify alignment with existing skills (`tdd-stub-first`, `code-review-checklist`, etc.).
- [x] Create a report (`Analysis/TDD_Improvement_Report.md`) detailing:
    - What can be executed.
    - How it improves the framework.
    - Implementation plan (list of skills to update).
- [x] Refine Report based on User Feedback:
    - [x] Detail "Minimal Code to Pass" checklists.
    - [x] Obtain final approval.

## Execution
- [x] Create `tdd-strict` (Tier 3) skill.
- [x] Update `developer-guidelines` (Tier 1) with Bug Protocol.
- [x] Update Checklists (`code-review`, `plan-review`).
- [x] Optimize Workflows (`full-robust`).
- [x] Verification (Simulation).
