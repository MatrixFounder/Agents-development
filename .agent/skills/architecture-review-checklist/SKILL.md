# Architecture Review Checklist

## 1. TASK Compliance
- [ ] **Coverage:** All Use Cases mapped to components?
- [ ] **Constraints:** All non-functional requirements met?

## 2. Data Model (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Completeness:** All entities, attributes, relationships defined?

## 5. Scalability & Reliability
- [ ] **Scaling:** Horizontal/Vertical strategy?
- [ ] **Faults:** Error handling, retries, backups?

## Criticality Protocol
- 🔴 **BLOCKING:** Data Model error, Security hole, Unmet TASK requirement.
- 🟡 **MAJOR:** Missing index, Questionable tech choice, Vague interface.
- 🟢 **MINOR:** Description clarity, typos.
