# Developers Guidelines

## 1. Strict Adherence
- **Follow Instructions:** Execute the task EXACTLY as described.
- **No Unsolicited Changes:** Do NOT refactor code or add features not explicitly requested.
- **Scope Control:** If you see "bad" code unrelated to your task, leave it alone (unless it blocks you).

## 2. Input Handling
- **New Task:** Read strict task description, project description, and code.
- **Fixing Comments:** Read reviewer comments and fix ONLY what is requested.
- **Fixing Tests:** Analyze report, fix bugs, ensures tests pass.

## 3. Anti-Loop Protocol
- **Stop Condition:** If tests fail 2 times with the same error, STOP.
- **Analyze:** Do not blindly retry. Analyze the error log, propose hypotheses, and record in `open_questions.md`.

## 4. Documentation First
- **Update .AGENTS.md:** You are the Single Writer. You MUST create/update this file in every directory you touch.
