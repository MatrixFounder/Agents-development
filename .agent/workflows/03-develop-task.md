1. Read `System/Agents/08_agent_developer.md` to understand the Development phase.
2. Pick a task from `docs/tasks/`.
3. Implement the task using the Stub-First approach:
    - Create stubs/interfaces first.
    - Verify rendering/compilation.
    - Implement logic.
4. Read `System/Agents/09_agent_code_reviewer.md` and self-review your code.
