> [!IMPORTANT]
> **VDD MODE ACTIVE**: You are now operating under Verification-Driven Development. Precision and decomposition are paramount.

1. **Standard Analysis**: Read `System/Agents/02_analyst_prompt.md`.
2. **Context Check**: Read `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
3. **Chainlink Decomposition (Part 1 - The Epics)**:
    - Update `docs/TZ.md`.
    - **Constraint**: You MUST structure the requirements into **Epics** and **Issues**.
    - **Constraint**: Do not accept vague requirements. If ambiguous, ask the user.
4. **Architecture**: Read `System/Agents/04_architect_prompt.md` and update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
